## Introduction
**OpenMORE** contains a library of sampling-based path replanning algorithms. It develops a framework to manage robot's trajectory execution with online path replanning. It is based on ROS and [MoveIt](https://moveit.github.io/moveit_tutorials/) to get information about the environment and collision checking. Check [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10275365) for more information.

    We are currently significantly changing the organisation of the library and updating the documentation. Expect new changes in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!

## Build & Install
While some `OpenMORE`'s packages are ROS-independent, others require compilation within a ROS workspace (e.g.,[`replanners_managers_lib`](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanners_managers_lib)). This tutorial assumes that `OpenMORE` and all its dependencies are installed within the same workspace.

First, install some utility packages following the steps indicated at [this page](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/cnr_common). These packages provides functionalities for logging, read/write parameters and loading plugins.

Create your workspace:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/openmore_ws/src
cd ~/openmore_ws
catkin init && catkin config --install
wstool init src
```
Download `OpenMORE` and its dependencies:
```bash
cd ~/openmore_ws
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/OpenMORE/master/OpenMORE.rosinstall
wstool merge -t src ./OpenMORE.rosinstall
wstool update -t src
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```
Finally, compile the workspace:
```bash
catkin build -cs
source devel/setup.bash
```
### Docker
A [docker file](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/OpenMORE/blob/master/dockerfile_OpenMORE) is also available. Open a terminal, move into the folder where you have saved the docker file and run the following command:
```
sudo docker build -f dockerfile_OpenMORE -t openmore .
```
Once completed, run the container:
```
xhost + 

sudo docker run -it --net=host --gpus all \
    --env="NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all" \
    --env="DISPLAY" \
    --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
    --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
    openmore
```
Then, inside the container you can try the library.

## Packages Overview
`OpenMORE` is organized into three core packages, each with a distinct role:

1. **[replanners_lib](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanners_lib)**: Implements various sampling-based path replanning algorithms for dynamic path replanning.

2. **[replanners_managers_lib](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanners_managers_lib)**: Provides a framework for managing and executing path replanning algorithms in real-time during robot trajectory execution.

3. **[trajectories_processors_lib](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/trajectories_processors_lib)**: Provides and interface to convert paths into trajectories and for trajectory interpolation.

## Tutorials
To get started with OpenMORE, refer to the following resources:

- **[Replanners Tutorials](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanners_lib/blob/master/README.md)**: Learn how to use and implement new path replanners.
- **[Replanner Managers Tutorials](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanners_managers_lib/blob/master/README.md)**: Explore how to create and manage replanner architectures.

Additionally, the **[`openmore_ros_examples`](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/openmore_ros_examples)** repository provides practical examples of using `OpenMORE` exploiting MoveIt for managing the planning scene.

## Work in progress
This repository is a work in progress and is continuously evolving. As such, it is not free of bugs.
 **Please be careful if you use it on real hardware and ensure all necessary safety measures are in place**.

If you find errors or if you have some suggestions, [please let us know](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/OpenMORE/issues).

We are actively seeking support for further development. If you're interested, please reach out via email at <mailto::c.tonola001@unibs.it>.

Future works:
1. Compatibility with ROS2
