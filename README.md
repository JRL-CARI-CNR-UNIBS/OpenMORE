The repository contains the implementation of a library of sampling-based path replanning algorithms. It develops a framework to manage robot's trajectory execution with continuous path replanning and collision checking of the current path. It is based on ROS and *MoveIt!* to get information about the environment and collision check. Check [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10013661?source=authoralert) for more information.
## Build/Installation
The software can be installed using rosinstall files.

1. Install ROS: follow the steps described in http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation
2. Install wstool: follow the steps described in http://wiki.ros.org/wstool
3. Install rosdep: follow the steps described in http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep
4. Install catkin_tools: follow the steps described in https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html

Create your workspace:
```
mkdir -p ~/replanning_ws/src
cd ~/replanning_ws
catkin init
wstool init src
```

Then, download and merge the rosinstall file:
```
cd ~/replanning_ws
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanning_strategies/master/replanning_strategies.rosinstall
wstool merge -t src ./replanning_strategies.rosinstall
```
Download and install the packages specified in the rosinstall file and the other system dipendencies:
```
cd ~/replanning_ws
wstool update -t src
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```
Finally, compile the workspace:
```
cd ~/replanning_ws
catkin build -cs
```
And source the workspace:
```
echo "source /home/$USER/replanning_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Quick examples
If you want to take a look at how the library works, you can run these two quick examples in which the robot follows a trajectory and replans it when a random object obstructs its path. The simulation is repeated with different replanning algorithms, with different performance in the two following scenarios.

To use a Cartesian point robot, launch:
```
roslaunch replanners_lib quick_example_3d.launch
```
To use a 6 dof anthropomorphic robot, launch:
```
roslaunch replanners_lib quick_example_6d.launch
```

## Packages
### **replanners_lib [see README](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanning_strategies/blob/master/replanners_lib)**
It contains two main repository:
 1. **replanners**: contains the implementation of some sample-based replanning algorithms.
 2. **replanner_managers**: contains the implementation of a framework to manage the trajectory execution with continuous replanning for each of the available replanners.

 You can implement your replanning algorithm and integrate it into the framework.

### **replanners_benchmark [see README](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanning_strategies/blob/master/replanners_benchmark)**
It contains a node to benchmark the available replanners and useful *launch* files. You can configure your benchmark or add new tests.

### **replanners_cells [see README](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanning_strategies/blob/master/replanners_cells)**
It contains the urdf and *moveit_config* packages of the environments used for benchmarking. You can add your scenario.
