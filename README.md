The repository contains a library of sampling-based path replanning algorithms. It develops a framework to manage robot's trajectory execution with online path replanning. It is based on ROS and MoveIt to get information about the environment and collision checking. Check [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10275365) for more information.

    We are currently significantly changing the organisation of the library and updating the documentation. Expect new changes in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!

## Build & Install
While many packages are ROS-independent, some require compilation within a ROS workspace (e.g.,[`replanners_managers_lib`](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanners_managers_lib)). This tutorial assumes that OpenMORE and all its dependencies are installed within the same workspace.

First, install some utility packages following the steps indicated at [this page](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/cnr_common). These packages provides functionalities for logging, read/write parameters and loading plugins.

Create your workspace:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/openmore_ws/src
cd ~/openmore_ws
catkin init && catkin config --install
wstool init src
```
Download OpenMORE and its dependencies:
```bash
cd ~/openmore_ws
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/OpenMORE/master/OpenMORE.rosinstall
wstool merge -t src ./OpenMORE.rosinstall
wstool update -t src
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```
Finally, compile the workspace:
```bash
catkin build -cs
source devel/setup.bash
```
### Docker
A [docker file](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/OpenMORE/blob/master/dockerfile_OpenMORE) is also available. Open a terminal, move into the folder where you have saved the docker file and run the following command:
```
sudo docker build -f dockerfile_OpenMORE -t openmore .
```
Once completed, run the container:
```
xhost + 

sudo docker run -it --net=host --gpus all \
    --env="NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all" \
    --env="DISPLAY" \
    --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
    --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
    openmore
```
Then, inside the container you can try the library (see Quick examples below).

<!-- ## Quick examples
If you want to take a look at how the library works, you can run these two quick examples in which the robot follows a trajectory and replans it when a random object obstructs its path. The simulation is repeated with different replanning algorithms, with different performance in the two following scenarios.

To use a Cartesian point robot, launch:
```
roslaunch replanners_lib quick_example_3d.launch
```
To use a 6 dof anthropomorphic robot, launch:
```
roslaunch replanners_lib quick_example_6d.launch
```
Note: when launching the examples you may get errors due to the lack of some libraries (e.g. trac-ik). They aren't needed for these examples, but you can install them with the following commands
```
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-trac-ik-kinematics-plugin ros-$ROS_DISTRO-chomp-motion-planner ros-$ROS_DISTRO-moveit-planners-chomp \ros-$ROS_DISTRO-pilz-industrial-motion-planner
``` -->

## Packages
OpenMORE consists of three packages:
 1. **replanners_lib [see README](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanners_lib)**: contains the implementation of some sampling-based path replanning algorithms;
 2. **replanners_managers_lib [see README](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanners_managers_lib)**: provides an architecture to run path replanning algorithms during the robot trajectory execution;
 3. **trajectories_processors_lib [see README](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/trajectories_processors_lib)**: provides an interface to compute a trajectory on a given path.

<!-- ### **replanners_benchmark [see README](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/OpenMORE/blob/master/replanners_benchmark)**
It contains a node to benchmark the available replanners and useful *launch* files. You can configure your benchmark or add new tests.

### **replanners_cells [see README](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/OpenMORE/blob/master/replanners_cells)**
It contains the urdf and *moveit_config* packages of the environments used for benchmarking. You can add your scenario. -->

## Work in progress
This repository is a work in progress and is continuously evolving. As such, it is not free of bugs. Please be careful if you use it on real hardware and take all necessary precautions.
If you find errors or if you have some suggestions, [please let us know](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/OpenMORE/issues).

We are actively seeking support for further development. If you're interested, please reach out via email at <mailto::c.tonola001@unibs.it>.

Future works:
1. Compatibility with ROS2
